Last year I played the game Pathfinder Kingmaker and had issues while trying to finish a quest. The quest required you kill 50 specific monsters spread throughout the game. However, the game did tell you which monsters you had killed, just how many. This made it difficult to complete the quest as if you were only missing 1 or 2 monsters, even if you looked online for their locations, if you didn&amp;rsquo;t know which monsters were missing you would still have to check all locations.</description>
