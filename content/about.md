Hello and welcome to my website, where I blend my personal blog with a professional portfolio. It's a space where my lifelong interests in programming, gaming, and technology come to life through various posts.

I hold a Bachelor of Information Technology and a Master of Data Science from the University of South Australia. My fascination with gaming as a child paved the way for my interest in programming, which began the moment I got my first PC. This curiosity naturally led me to explore web development during my teenage years, especially creating fan sites for my favorite games.

My professional journey started in game development but later shifted towards Data Engineering, with an interesting stint as a Data Scientist in between. These days, my focus is on data orchestration, handling platforms like Dagster and Airflow. I’ve also worked with tools like Databricks, Snowflake, and Google BigQuery, and have familiarized myself with various cloud services including AWS and GCP. Professionally, I mostly work with Python to build data pipelines, but I keep my passion for web development alive through personal projects using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and more. I’m also looking forward to revisiting C# or C++ for some game development on the side, and maybe even dabbling in Rust for fun.

In the fintech sector, I’ve had the opportunity to work with both startups, established financial service providers and wealth managements funds. While the financial world has been an interesting, I'm pining to exploring new domains that spark my interest. Nevertheless, no matter the domaion, I still enjoy Data Engineering and seek to keep bettering myself at it.
