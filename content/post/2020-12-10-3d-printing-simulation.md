This project was developed for a university assignment to understand the use of game engines. The engine in this case being [Unity](https://unity.com/). The task was to develop a 3D printing simulations using certain features of Unity. It had to be 3D with a first-person view point and keyboard-based locomotion. The 3D printer itself had to be controlled via an in-game button interface and the printing needed to be visualised in a unique way of my choice. We were also tasked to develop one interesting feature of our own.

* Programming logic using **C#** and **Visual Studio IDE**.
* Used many **3D model** assets freely available from Unity and from the asset store to build the environment.
* The 3D printer model was created by me using [Blender](https://www.blender.org/).
* I implemented a resource system as a **extra feature**:
    * 3D Printing uses a finite resource called “Filament”.
    * It’s possible to recycle printed objects turning them into filament capsules.
    * Can insert capsules into printer to regain filament.

# Lessons Learned:

With this project I learned the usefulness of using pre-made libraries and models if they work for the situation. It was also a great exercise in learning various different softwares and how they work together to complete a fully idealised product.
