Hi, I'm Sean. This web page acts as my portfolio and blog. I have a Bachelor of I.T. and Masters of Data Science and have worked in game development and fintech companies. The contents of this site will include projects that I've worked on in my spare time, tutorials, opinions and various other things that hold my interest. Please feel free to contact me using any of the outlets available below my picture on the left sidebar.
