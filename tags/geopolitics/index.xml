      <description>Code Report  thisisthestartofsummary
This was a project completed for a University assignment. Our task was to find an interesting dataset and visualize it in a meaningful and in depth way. I searched through kaggle and found a dataset for conflicts in Africa, then found its source, the ACLED website, and obtained even more up to date data. I used R for the visualization and combined the ACLED data with other datasets from the world bank, such as GDP and Population, to gain more understanding of the data and attempt to find hidden meaning.</description>
