Welcome to my website, a dynamic blend of a blog and portfolio. My lifelong fascination with programming, gaming, and technology is the heartbeat of this space, with each post echoing these passions.

I hold a Bachelor of Information Technology and a Master of Data Science from the University of South Australia. My journey began in the vibrant world of gaming during my childhood, which naturally evolved into a keen interest in programming - initially fueled by my ambition to create games. This early fascination soon branched out into web development in my teen years, driven by my eagerness to craft fan sites for my favorite games.

Professionally, I began in game development, but my career path took a turn towards the more specialized and rewarding realm of Data Engineering, with an interlude as a Data Scientist. Currently, my focus lies in data orchestration, where I have gained extensive experience with platforms like Dagster and Airflow. My proficiency extends to working with Databricks, Snowflake, and Google BigQuery, alongside a comprehensive understanding of various cloud services provided by AWS and GCP.

While my professional life predominantly revolves around utilizing Python for building robust data pipelines, my personal projects often involve web development tools like JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and more. I'm eager to revisit C# or C++ for some hobbyist game development projects and am also keen on exploring Rust for its unique capabilities.

In the realm of fintech, I have navigated through roles in startups, financial service providers, and management funds as a contractor, enriching my experience in both large and small companies. Although the financial sector has been my primary domain, I aspire to venture into fields that align more closely with my personal interests. Nonetheless, the role of a Data Engineer remains intrinsically fascinating to me, irrespective of the industry.
