      <description>Trailer LibGDX Demo Code  thisisthestartofsummary
RuneCaster started as a game project I developed at University based on an assignment I was given to build a mobile game using the Java library LibGDX. Mobile games weren&amp;rsquo;t something I personally played so it was a learning process for me and required me to look into and test other popular games on the platform. I wanted to make use a strength of mobile devices, the touch screen, so the main mechanic was to cast spells by drawing matching runes once prompted on the screen.</description>

This project was developed for a university assignment to understand the use of game engines. The engine in this case being Unity. The task was to develop a 3D printing simulations using certain features of Unity. It had to be 3D with a first-person view point and keyboard-based locomotion. The 3D printer itself had to be controlled via an in-game button interface and the printing needed to be visualised in a unique way of my choice.</description>

Quark was a game devised for a game design university project. It was developed with a group of 4 people using Unreal Engine 4. It is a birds-eye stealth game with the premise being: You are a pacifist scientist and your lab facility has just been infiltrated by a malicious enforcer group. You must use the gadgets around your laboratory to escape without being detected. We designed different gadgets that had distinct game mechanics interacting with enemy AI, and interesting levels to traverse.</description>
